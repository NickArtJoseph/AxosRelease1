Hello,

My name is {!Contact.OwnerFullName} and I want to introduce myself to you as the Non-Profit Banking Relationship Manager at Axos Bank. In the current rate environment I have found that most non-profits and religious organizations arenâ€™t receiving competitive returns on their reserve funds, and therefore it may be time for you to reevaluate your existing banking relationship. 

At Axos Bank, we have a deep understanding of your industry and will work with you to identify your financial needs. Our products will safeguard your reserve assets at highly competitive interest rates and we will personalize your banking experience. With our innovative banking solutions, you have a relationship built to help you with the long-term financial health of your religious organization. 

Sincerely,
