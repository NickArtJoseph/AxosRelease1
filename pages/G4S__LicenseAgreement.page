                    <p><b>1. Subscription Services </b><br /> 
                    This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions governing Glance Networks' 
                    ("Glance") performance and delivery of its service ("Service") described in any 
                    associated Subscription Contract ("Contract"). Customer may subscribe to and purchase 
                    the Service by executing a Contract setting forth the applicable Service subscription 
                    period ("Subscription Period") subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 
                    Service is for Customer use only, and not for the purpose of redistribution or resale 
                    of the Service; Customer may not resell service to third party individuals and 
                    entities. Each Contract will be subject to this master agreement, notwithstanding any 
                    inconsistent or additional provisions contained therein. The application of this 
                    master agreement is automatic and unvariable without the express contrary agreement of 
                    both parties. Contracts will be governed only by the terms and conditions of this 
                    Agreement and any different or additional terms in any other document are deemed 
                    inapplicable. No Agreement or Contract is binding unless or until it is accepted by 
                    Glance in writing.</p> 
 
                    <p><b>2. Glance Personal Subscription</b><br /> 
                    Customer shall provide all user information reasonably necessary to enable Glance to 
                    create a profile for the person for whom Customer wishes to have access to the Service, 
                    pursuant to this Agreement ("Subscriber"). During the Term of this Agreement, Customer 
                    may: i) designate one (1) Glance web page address for each Subscription, and ii) 
                    initiate one (1) Glance session at a time for each Glance Personal Subscription to the 
                    Service. Customer is responsible for updating any and all information related to 
                    Subscriber in its Customer account.</p> 
 
                    <p><b>3. Glance Corporate Subscription </b><br />Customer shall provide all user 
                    information reasonably necessary to enable Glance to create profiles for each user for 
                    whom Customer wishes to have access to the Service, pursuant to this Agreement 
                    ("Subscribers"). During the Term of this Agreement Customer may: i) designate one (1) 
                    Glance web page address for each Subscriber, and ii) initiate one (1) Glance session at 
                    a time for each Subscription to the Service. Customer is responsible for updating any 
                    and all information related to Subscribers in its Customer account.</p> 
 
                    <p><b>4. Term </b><br /> 
                    The term of this Agreement ("Term") commences on the Commencement Date as set forth in 
                    the Contract. The Agreement and any associated Contract shall continue and renew 
                    automatically at the end of the Renewal Period ("Period"), unless either party notifies 
                    the other of its intent to terminate this Agreement by providing the other party written 
                    notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of any term of the 
                    Agreement or of any Service period or immediately, in Glance's sole discretion, if 
                    Customer breaches the Agreement. Contracts commence on the Commencement Date indicated 
                    in the Contract. Monthly subscriptions unless earlier terminated, shall continue and 
                    renew automatically each month. Yearly subscriptions, unless earlier terminated, shall 
                    continue and renew each year. Service fees and charges are nonrefundable.</p> 
 
                    <p><b>5. Payments and Amendments </b><br /> 
                    Glance reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Service immediately after the 
                    due date of a correctly rendered and non-contested invoice in the event that Customer 
                    fails to pay Glance by the due date. Glance may change the fees and charges then in 
                    effect, or add new fees or charges, whenever Contract renews, with thirty (30) days 
                    notice.</p> 
                    <p>The fees payable to Glance by Customer shall be exclusive of all governmental, 
                    federal, state or local excise, sales, value-added, use and other taxes now or 
                    hereafter levied or imposed on the Service provided under this Agreement. Customer 
                    agrees to pay or have paid all fees and charges incurred in connection with Service 
                    (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. 
                    Customer is responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access Service through an 
                    Internet access provider or other third party service.</p> 
 
                    <p>5.1 <i>Credit Card Billing</i>. As specified in the Contract, periodic fees for 
                    the Subscription Period will be billed automatically to the credit card provided to 
                    Glance prior to the Commencement Date and prior to each subsequent Subscription 
                    Renewal Period. Payments are due prior to activation of the Service.</p> 
                    <p>Unless otherwise stated, as a condition to the right to use the Service, Customer must provide a valid credit card number belonging to Customer with available credit sufficient to pay the applicable Service fees. In the event that Customer cancels this credit card or it is otherwise terminated, Customer must immediately provide Glance with a new valid credit card number. Customer authorizes Glance, from time to time, to undertake steps to determine whether the credit card number provided is a valid credit card number. In the event that Customer does not provide a current valid credit card number with sufficient credit upon request during the effective period of this Agreement, Customer will be in violation of this Agreement, and Glance may terminate this Agreement with Customer immediately. Glance does not accept debit cards for payment of Service Fees. In the event that Customer provides a debit card number instead of a credit card number, Customer authorizes Glance to make all charges described in this Agreement to Customer's debit card account. CUSTOMER, AND NOT GLANCE, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMER CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, WHICH WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY CUSTOMER.</p> 
                    <p>5.2 <i>Purchase Order Billing</i>. Purchase order billing is available only to qualified customers and may be subject to additional processing fees. Periodic fees for the Subscription Period as specified in the Contract, will be billed automatically to the purchase order designated to Glance prior to the Commencement Date of the initial Subscription Period and at the start of each Subscription Renewal Period. Payments are due prior to activation of the Service. Purchase order invoices are due and payable, in U.S. dollars, within fifteen (15) days of the Commencement Date of any Subscription Period. </p> 
                    <p>5.3 <i>Trial Offers, Coupons, Credits and Special Offers</i>. Glance reserves the right to discontinue or modify trial offers, coupons, credits and special promotional offers at Glance's sole discretion. Any trial offer associated with the Service entitles new users to a one-time free trial usage period. At the end of the trial period the user will be automatically terminated unless a paid service plan is purchased prior to the end of the trial period as set forth in the Contract.</p> 
                    <p><b>6. Use of Customer Name </b><br />Customer agrees that Glance Networks may use Customer's name and logo in advertisements, other promotional material and Glance's website, only upon prior written approval for such use by Customer.</p>

If Customer breaches this clause, Glance shall have the right to suspend or terminate the Service immediately without notice to the Customer. The Customer shall keep Glance fully indemnified from and against all costs, claims, liabilities, and demands, relating to any breach of this clause.</p> 
                    <p>7.3 <i>Responsibility for User Accounts and Passwords</i>. Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of User accounts and passwords. Customer agrees to immediately notify Glance of any unauthorized use of Customer account of which customer becomes aware. Otherwise, all guarantees as to service and performance given by Glance to the Customer shall be suspended.</p> 
                    <p>7.4 <i>Customer Only Traffic</i>. The right to use the Service is limited only to the Customer registered Subscribers and their invited attendees and includes those members of staff and others engaged by the Customer to perform work for the Customer. </p> 
                    <p>7.5 <i>Email</i>. Sending unsolicited mail messages, including, without limitation, commercial advertising and informational announcements, is explicitly prohibited. A Subscriber shall not use Glance's mail server to relay mail other than invitations to share its own data without the express permission of Glance.</p> 
                    <p>7.6 <i>Network Security</i>. Violations of system or network security are prohibited, and may result in criminal and civil liability. Glance will investigate incidents involving such violations and may involve and will cooperate with law enforcement if a criminal violation is suspected. Examples of system or network security violations include, without limitation, the following:
                        <ol class="alpha"> 
                            <li>Unauthorized access to or use of data, systems or networks, including any attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without express authorization of the owner of the system or network.</li>

                    </p> 
 
                    <p>7.7 <i>Improper Use</i>. Services may be used only for lawful purposes. Transmission, distribution or storage of any material in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited. This includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right used without proper authorization, and material that is obscene, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, or violates export control laws.</p>
